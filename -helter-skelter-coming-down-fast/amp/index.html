But for many the idealism of that decade really died in brutal and bloody fashion in Los Angeles the previous year.</p><p>In late Summer 1969, a set of grisly mass murders committed on consecutive nights would shock Hollywood with their ferocity. Although seven people in all were killed, the press and public focused on the death of the heavily pregnant Sharon Tate, an up and coming film actress who had recently married famous Polish film director Roman Polanski.</p><p>The first murders occurred in the early hours of August 9th at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, an upscale area of Los Angeles popular with musicians and actors. Even by the violent standards of the era, the killings were shocking.</p><p>Sharon Tate, men's hair stylist Jay Sebring, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, her boyfriend Wojciech Frykowski and student Steve Parent had all been slaughtered, their bloodied and beaten bodies scattered around the house and gardens. Those responsible for the carnage had written the word 'Pig' in blood on the property's front door.</p><p>The following night, 10 miles away in a suburban area of Los Feliz, two more people were butchered. Supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, a dress shop co-owner, were bound and brutally stabbed to death by home invaders. The killers left behind the words "Rise", "Death to pigs" and "Healter Skelter" in their victims blood.</p><p>Police initially believed the murders at Cielo drive were the result of a drug transaction that had gone wrong, dismissing any suggestions in the press that the killings were linked to the similar Labianca murders  the following night, despite both crime scenes featuring inflammatory messages written in the victim's blood.</p><p>The drug motive seemed logical considering the huge spike in violent crime that accompanied the explosion of drug use during the 1960s. There was also the similar drug-related murder of music teacher Gary Hinman just weeks earlier, that involved a group who would soon become centre-stage - Charles Manson and his followers, dubbed 'The Manson Family'.</p><p>Hinman was held hostage for three days by Manson member and budding musician Bobby Beausoleil for unpaid drug debts, during which Manson dropped by and cut part of Hinman's ear off with a cutlas. Beausoleil and another Manson follower - Susan Atkins, eventually stabbed Hinman to death and wrote "Political piggy" on the walls in his blood.</p><p>Despite the obvious fact this crime was related to the recent carnage at Cielo Drive, police seemingly failed to make any connection.</p><p>Meanwhile, amidst much sensational and lurid media coverage, wild rumours began to spread. These were heady and strange times in Hollywood, drug use and violence were rife and all manner of crackpots, cults, biker gangs, mobsters and even Satanists were connected by the press to the murders.</p><p>One group not suspected was an informal commune of hippies, dropouts, petty criminals and drug addicts who were ensconced at an old movie set in Death valley called Spahn Ranch. Although a whole group of them were arrested shortly after the murders on suspicion of auto theft, they were subsequently let go without charge due to a legal problem with the arrest warrants.</p><p>One of those arrested and released was Charles Manson, a lifetime petty criminal and budding musician who had been hovering around the periphery of the Hollywood scene since he was released on parole the year before. Manson had befriended such luminaries as Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and Neil Young, both of whom felt the eccentric Manson had promise as a musician.</p><p>The police investigation into the Tate-Labianca murders had begone to go cold when, in November, they made a crucial breakthrough. Susan Atkins, in jail for the murder of Gary Hinman, began to admit to various prison cellmates of her and other Spahn Ranch residents responsibility for the Tate and Labianca killings.</p><p>Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwkeel, and Linda Kasabian were subsequently arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murders. But it was Manson himself, now in custody for the auto-theft charges he had previously evaded, who would soon become central to the case.</p><p>Susan Atkins was initially offered immunity to testify against Manson and the other accused murderers but was regarded as so crazy and unstable as to be a liability to the case. It would ultimately be Linda Kasabian, who says she assisted but did not directly participate in the murders, who would be offered immunity to testify against her cohorts.</p><p>After months of pre-trial wranglings, in July 1970 the trial started in earnest. Whilst the Los Angeles district attorney's office had acknowledged that others had committed the actual murders, prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi wanted to portray Charles Manson as the mastermind of the killings.</p><p>Described by the melodramatic Bugliosi as 'the Trial of the Century', a vast media circus quickly surrounded proceedings,  much of it centered around the strange figure of Charles Manson. From almost complete obscurity, the often bewildered Manson soon found himself elevated to the status of a national bogeyman, a place in the American psyche he has continued to occupy for nearly 50 years.</p><p>Demonised in the press, Manson was portrayed as the nightmare of every middle-class parent. A kind of sinister pied piper figure brainwashing otherwise good kids into brutal acts of violence. In an extraordinary move, President Nixon would come out and publicly declare him guilty before the trial has even properly begun.</p><p>Defensive lawyers filed for a mistrial but were denied, as were their efforts to have the trial moved to a less prejudicial setting. The judge ruled that the publicity and media attention surrounding Manson was so huge that it would be hard to find an impartial jury anywhere in the country.</p><p>Manson looked doomed before the prosecution even set out their case. On the flimsiest of evidence, Manson would be portrayed as an evil cult leader who used his magnetic personality to hypnotise his followers into doing his devilish work. This scenario struck a chord with the jury and the public and has since become the widely accepted truth of the matter.</p><p>Bugliosi and his team still had a problem, however. Manson may have exerted enough psychological control over his followers to persuade them to murder for him, but what was the motive? The LA District attorney's office was keen to overlook the amount of illegal drugs found at Cielo drive, and there had been no discernable robbery, so why had Manson ordered the brutal murder of seven people?</p><p>It was here one of the most extraordinary prosecution theories in criminal history was born. Chiefly dreamt up by Vincent Bugliosi, the case against Manson would centre on his contention that Manson was a homicidal racist who ordered his followers to commit mass-murder in order to start an apocalyptic race war in America.</p><p>Crucially, as we shall subsequently see, those that died were thus portrayed as indiscriminate unlucky victims, picked entirely at random to fulfill some crazed scheme of Manson's.</p><p>This plan, which Manson supposedly called 'Helter Skelter' was inspired by a bizarre mishmash of the New Testament Book of Revelation and lyrics from the Beatles 1968 double album 'The Beatles', which Manson twisted to become a message to rise up before the black man gained the upper hand.</p><p>After starting the race-war, Manson and his followers would eventually emerge in the aftermath as rulers of the world, with the remaining black population as their slaves. As outlandish as this may sound, the jury bought Bugliosi's theory and Manson and the murderers were all found guilty and subsequently sentenced to death.</p><p>These sentences were later commuted to life after California abolished the death penalty in 1972, and all of those convicted remain in prison to this day, unlikely ever to be released despite the periodic ritual of futile parole hearings.</p><p>In 1974, Bugliosi wrote a book about the trial titled 'Helter Skelter', which further reinforced this extraordinary scenario in the public mind. It went on to become the biggest selling true-crime book of all time.</p><p>But how much truth was there in Helter Skelter? Even some of Bugliosi's colleagues, like fellow prosecutor Aaron Stovitz, were skeptical about the bizarre theory.</p><p>Could the far less sensational explanation be that these were simply violent drug murders of the type that had become sadly all too common in the area? And Manson a convenient scapegoat?</p><h4>Evidence For</h4><h5>Helter Skelter</h5><p>During the trial, Charles Manson was given a psychological evaluation by state psychologists and found to be entirely sane and rational. It was also discovered he had a higher than normal IQ and a sound grasp of legal procedure, enough that he was deemed capable of representing himself.</p><p>Yet according to Bugliosi's prosecution theory, this street-wise and wily ex-con devised a plan - Helter Skelter, that is mainly noted for its  staggering inanity. Both the plan and, unfortunate pun aside, its execution were so absurd as to be laughable.</p><p>But Bugliosi's intense zeal to pursue Manson and to push his Helter Skelter theory seemed to override the widespread skepticism and objections of  other prosecutors, the police, the judge, investigators and multiple other commentators on the case, all of whom expressed their doubt about a notion even Bugliosi would occasionally describe as ridiculous.</p><p>Bugliosi's Helter Skelter theory contended that Manson, inspired by his twisted reading of lyrics on the Beatle's White Album, came to believe a race war - 'Helter Skelter' was imminent. Supposedly spurred on by his vicious racism he wanted to precipitate the war between white and blacks so he could emerge afterward as the leader of the remaining black population.</p><p>Already, this seems too strange to actually be the plan of someone who was not seriously mentally disturbed, which Manson certainly wasn't. But how they were to provoke Helter Skelter is even more unbelievable.</p><p>According to Bugliosi, Manson would order his followers, who were under his hypnotic spell, to go out and murder some rich white people in such a way as it would be blamed on the black population. To this end, he sent Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Patricia Krenwinkel out into Beverley Hills to enact his evil plot.</p><p>In the early hours of August 9th, they happened upon Sharon Tate's house, slaughtered everyone inside then wrote the word 'pig' on the door in Tate's blood. This masterstroke would make it appear the crimes had been committed by blacks, thus starting Manson's race war.</p><p>One obvious problem with this plan is the word pig was not used exclusively by the black population. In actual fact, it was old English slang for police, adopted predominantly by the white middle-class anti-establishment movement of the 1960s. The idea the police would infer the use of the word meant the perpetrators were black is ridiculous.</p><p>Since everyone involved with the murders that night were white and middle class, it's fairly obviously they would have known this. Perhaps Manson himself realized how weak his plan was, because according to Bugliosi, the next night he ordered more murders, again with the intention been to make it appear they had been committed by blacks.</p><p>On August 10th, Tex Watson, Linda Kasabian, Susan Atkins, Steve Grogan and Leslie Van Houten again took to the streets of Los Angeles looking for more victims. Although joined initially by Manson, he would leave before anybody was killed. Happening upon the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, a similar tale of bloody murder unfolded inside and more inflammatory slogans were written in blood on the walls.</p><p>According to Linda Kasabian, actually more involved in the killings than Manson was, but offered immunity for her testimony against him, the idea this time was to take LaBianca's wallet and leave it in a black area of town. Manson's diabolical intention was that a black man would find the wallet, use the credit cards and subsequently be blamed for the murders.</p><p>To this end, Kasabian hid the wallet inside a cistern at a gas station hotel, in a predominately white area of town, where it wouldn't be found for another 4 months.  Evidently, leaving a wallet in a cistern is not a serious attempt to start a race-war, so whatever the gang were up to that night it appeared to bear little relation to the notion of Helter Skelter.</p><p>In practice, Bugliosi's explanation for the actions of the murderers over the two nights make no sense and look for all the world like a far-fetched prosecutorial concoction created after the fact, designed to implicate somebody who was not even present - Charles Manson, in the killings.</p><p>When Tex Watson, the ring leader on both nights of carnage and the man who actually committed the murders, heard about the Helter Skelter plot been pushed by the prosecution and Manson's alleged hypnotic powers, he was heard to say - "Charlie! Fuck man, no way!".</p><p>Watson's involvement was almost the most absurd part of Bugliosi's entire case. Whereas it's not too hard to see how the charismatic older  Manson might be able to persuade impressionable young girls to do his bidding, the idea that Tex Watson - a tall, good-looking and well-educated alpha male type could be so comprehensively manipulated seems particularly unlikely.</p><p>Watson was never part of the inside circle around Manson and actually spent little time at the Spahn ranch, preferring to hang out in LA and develop his drug dealing career. Whilst superficially charming and charismatic, Watson was a violent psychopath and not the kind of man to be pushed around by anyone, least of all the much shorter Manson.</p><p>He also had form, having ripped off black drug dealer Bernard Crowe a few months earlier, and tied up and robbed Mafia-connected drug dealer Joel Roseau and his girlfriend the previous month. Watson's behaviour indicated he was following his own criminal path, rather than Manson's hypnotic will, and probably regarded the wily old-con more as useful ally than master.</p><p>So his initial incredulity at being informed he was actually under Manson's evil, cult-like spell was well placed. In reality, a far more convincing reason for Watson and the other members of the so-called 'family' to blame it all on Manson was to try and save their own skin.</p><p>If Watson could make it look like he had been brainwashed into committing the murders and he was otherwise a good Christian boy, then he might just escape the inevitable death sentence coming to someone who had brutally murdered seven people in cold blood.</p><p>Clearly the testimony of these murders was self-serving and unreliable as genuine evidence, either against Manson or regarding any aspect of the case. But it is not a prosecutor's job to find the truth, only to persuade a jury, and Bugliosi's courtroom flair managed to do exactly that.</p><p>He was helped in no small part by the prejudiced media reporting  surrounding the trial that gave Manson little or no chance of a fair hearing. Furthermore, as his position looked increasingly doomed, Manson  himself seemed determined to give the public what they wanted, playing up to the fantasy of the evil cult leader in a series of increasingly eccentric courtroom appearances.</p><p>But the craziness was a showman's act, Manson was perfectly aware he was been railroaded by the ambitious prosecutor - “I was convicted of witchcraft in the Twentieth Century and my case made the prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, filthy rich behind the book and the film he wrote."</p><p>Indeed, Bugliosi became world famous off the back of the case, and would frequently refer to the fact he was the man that 'prosecuted Charles Manson' when promoting his books or political ambitions.</p><p>Despite building an entire career off the back of the Manson trial, Bugliosi's achievement  essentially boiled down to convincing 12 people that Manson had sufficient quasi-mystical abilities to convince others to commit brutal murder for him. In other words, witchcraft in the 20th century.</p><h5>The Drugs Connection</h5>
